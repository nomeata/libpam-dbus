pam-dbus
=======

This simple pam module will, when being used to authenticate a (typically 
remote) user, use dbus to ask any currently logged in (typically local)
user if that is ok.

It connects to the object "de.nomeata.pam_dbus" at the path "/de/nomeata/pam_dbus",
expecting the "de.nomeata.pam_dbus" interface and then call the method "MayLogin".
It passes four strings (service, user, rhost, ruser), some of which might be NULL
and expectes one boolean value, which should be true if the remote user may login.

It has a timeout of 5 minutes after which the UI may stop waiting for a reply.
